# ClassificationAlgorithms
Comparing the performance of 3 Classification Algorithms; Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine on a dataset.
<br>
This is a Python code that reads a dataset from a CSV file, performs some data exploration and analysis, and trains three machine learning models on the data. The three models are a <b>Decision Tree, a Random Forest, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM)</b>, and the code uses hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters for each model. Finally, the code evaluates the performance of each model on a test dataset using various metrics, including precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. The SVM model is determined to be the best model among the three based on its performance metrics. <br>
The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. It then reads the dataset from a CSV file using the pandas read_csv() function and prints out information about the dataset, including the number of samples for each class and histograms of the features.<br>
The code then splits the data into training and testing datasets using the scikit-learn train_test_split() function. It trains a Decision Tree model on the training data and uses GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the model. The best hyperparameters are then used to train a new Decision Tree model on the training data, and the model is evaluated on the test data using various metrics.<br>
The code then repeats the same process for a Random Forest model, using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters and evaluating the model on the test data using various metrics.<br>
Finally, the code repeats the same process for an SVM model, using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters and evaluating the model on the test data using various metrics. It then plots a confusion matrix for the best models and a bar graph showing the precision, recall, and F1 score for each class.
